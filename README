# Rukmal Weerawarana's World

This website is my attempt to not only centralize my amazingly abundant sloth of social websites, but also it is also an 'exploration' project of sorts for me. This is my first exposure to using Node.js, let alone maintaining and running my own server!

## Current Implementation
Currently, the site does not do very much in terms of having a working backend, as no site-related server side processing has to be done yet. Because of this, the only JavaScript currently in use is limited to the jQuery objects being used to control the animations on the site.

Apart from this, the site is currently being hosted on a Raspberry Pi in my dorm room using Node.js and express as the middleware and server stack. If I do see a spike in traffic after I launch the site, I may consider using another Pi to help manage the load on the server.

## Future Plans
I hope to expand the site to include my blog, which has been largely unused for a while. I used to host it on blogger, but to go along with the whole DIY theme of this site, I plan on hosting and managing it on my server as well.

Currently, I have no concrete plans as to how I'm going to implement this, but I hope to eventually include an actual 'comments' section for the blog. I plan to use some combination of JS and JSON to manage to data for me, as this will go well with the Node.js server implementation I'm currently using.

On the server side, if I do ever have to include additional Pi's in the infrastructure, I hope to continue to use Node.js and express as the backend for my server, as I find it to not only be easy to use, but also amazingly efficient.
